"""nvMolKit - GPU-accelerated RDKit functionality.

nvMolKit provides GPU-accelerated implementations of common RDKit operations
to improve performance for large-scale cheminformatics workflows. APIs match
RDKit as closely as possible, but expand to support batches of molecules, which
is critical for GPU performance.

Currently supported functionality:
- Batch Morgan Fingerprint calculation
- Bulk tanimoto/cosine similarity calculations between fingerprints
- ETKDG conformer generation for multiple molecules
- MMFF optimization for multiple molecules and conformers
- TFD (Torsion Fingerprint Deviation) calculation for conformer comparison
